## IP Address Range Collection 

This is a library to work with ranges of IP addresses.

This library enables to read a database of IP addresses stored in a CSV file 
and compressed as a ZIP file into an object in memory (RAM) and make fast 
search queries to this database. 

### Details

The database contains a sequential list of IP address ranges associated with 
various data. In this example data consists of a country associated with the 
range. 

Countries are represented by standardized two-letter codes and names in English 
language. Each IP address range stores a pointer to an object, called 'struct' 
in Go programming language. Each data object may have various fields which are 
very easy to expand as the code is written in such a manner which allows very 
easy additions of new classes or types. 

IP addresses use the IPv4 standard.

It is an interesting fact that the total number of all IP addresses of the IPv6 
standard is 2^128 which is approximately 3.4Ã—10^38 or 
340'282'366'920'938'463'463'374'607'431'768'211'456 addresses. Humankind has 
not yet invented a storage technology big enough to store all possible IP 
addresses of the IPv6 standard.

### Database Source

Database is taken from the https://lite.ip2location.com website and is free to 
use.

The source file was slightly modified in following ways:  
1. Lines with empty country were standardized for the reader.
2. Double quotes were removed from there where they were not necessary.

**Last update time of the database**: 2023-12-03.

## Usage

This library is ready to be used as a search database for IP-based geolocation.

### What is IP-based Geolocation ?

IP-based geolocation is the mapping of an IP address to the real-world 
geographic location of an Internet-connected computing or a mobile device.

## Performance

Stress test shows an average RPS of about 32M for the whole test on a decent
hardware. The test iterates through all possible IPv4 addresses, i.e. from
0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. Search algorithm uses binary search in array.
